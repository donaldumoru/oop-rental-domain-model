# oop-rental-domain-model

Object-oriented JavaScript practice project modeling a property rental domain

### Overview

This is a practice OOP JavaScript project where I explore structuring a property rental system around roles and lifecycles. The focus here is on separating responsibilities between HomeSeekers, Applications, Landlords, Properties, and Tenants and also on modeling how a user transitions from 'applicant' to 'tenant' through an approval workflow.
The goal of the project is to practice OOP design decisions and NOT to build a complete production-ready application.

### Out of Scope

The focus of this project is on domain modeling and object-oriented design and NOT on building a complete application. As a result, the following aspects are out of scope:

- User interface
- Data persistence
- Authentication, authorization, and any security concerns
